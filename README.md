# DiscreteFourierTransform
This project provide some algorithms for Discrete Fourier Transform with python3.2

## Feature
- Support for real number discrete fourier transform
- Support synthesis original signals according the frequency domian real and image part data
- Support analysis frequency domian real and image part data according time domian signals
- Support correlation method to analysis time domain signals

## Develop Tool
- [python3.2 32bit](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.2/)
- [VS Code 1.20.1](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Other
- This library is based on the open source book: [The Scientist and Engineer's Guide to Digital Signal Processing](http://www.dspguide.com/)
